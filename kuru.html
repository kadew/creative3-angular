				<p>This is a comic I've been working on slowly over a couple of years. It follows the story of a playthrough of Pokemon Red Version I did a while back, under "Nuzlocke" rules.</p>
				<p>Nuzlocke rules are as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Only capture the first pokemon encountered on a given route</li>
					<li>If a pokemon of yours faints in battle, it is considered dead and must be released.</li>
				</ol>
			</div class="panel">

		<div class="center" ng-controller="mainCtrl">
			<img src="comic/title.png">
			<div ng-repeat="page in arts ">
				<img ng-src="{{ page }}" />
			</div>
			<p>And that's how far I've drawn :V</p>
		</div>

				<p>I made another site for the comic a while back, but I wanted to test this with Angular as a means of displaying every page in once long continuous scroll, since Angular's ng-repeat method is good for going through lists like that quickly. And so, I made this for the creative project.</p>
				<p>Fun fact: the title, "Kurukkoo!" is the sound pidgey make in the game.</p>

				$scope.arts  = [];
				for (var i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
					var id = i.toString();
					id = id.padStart(3, "0");
					id = "comic/" + id + ".png";
					$scope.arts.push(id);
				}
